## Hardware Upgrade & AI Hosting
- **Current Discussion:** Adam is evaluating **Beelink** mini PCs (specifically SER8/SER9) as an alternative to the **Minisforum UM790 Pro**.
- **Reasoning:** Rumors/opinions that Beelink might be better optimized for OpenClaw/local hosting.
- **Power Consumption Analysis:**
    - Idle: 10-15W.
    - AI Workload: 35-50W.
    - Max: 90W.
    - **Estimated Cost (Poland 2026):** ~25-40 PLN/month for 24/7 operation (based on 1.20 PLN/kWh).
- **Status:** Adam has not purchased yet. Looking for the best "AI-performance-to-price" ratio.

## Business Context (Automation Odyssey)
- **Goal:** Hosting local LLMs (Llama 3 8B/70B) for the assistant gateway and business automations.
- **Budget:** ~3000 PLN Gross.

## Decisions/Pivots
- Rejected the complicated "manual assembly" route (UM790 Barebone + separate RAM/SSD) due to extreme price volatility and marketplace scams on Morele.pl.
- Pivot to **ready-to-use (ready-built)** units to ensure compatibility and warranty.

## Next Steps
- Finalize Beelink vs Minisforum comparison (focus on NPU/GPU performance for AI).
- Confirm final purchase link.
