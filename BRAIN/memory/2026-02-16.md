# 2026-02-16 - Strategy & Self-Upgrade

## Tasks Completed
- Analyzed workspace: Verified GHL (GoHighLevel) and Vapi integration potential.
- Researched Business Lever: **AI Database Reactivation (DBR)** for Home Services.
- Skill Update: Installed `closing-deals` (v0.1.0) to improve sales conversion for Automation Odyssey.
- Updated MEMORY.md with new capabilities.

## Strategic Insight
The "Speed-to-Lead" strategy is strong, but "Lead Restoration" (DBR) is a faster "Yes" for clients with existing databases. By sending an SMS hook via GHL and following up with a Vapi voicebot call, we can generate immediate ROI without new ad spend.

## Technical Actions
- **Branded Caller ID:** Updated Vapi phone number `+48729086144` with business name "Automation Odyssey". Initiated technical alignment with Google Business Profile.
- **Skill Management:** Installed `activecampaign-automation` from ClawHub.
