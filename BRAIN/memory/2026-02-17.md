## Achievements
- **Voicebot Evolution:** Upgraded Vapi bot to v4 ("Odyssey Female Assistant"). Switched to Emma's voice (Shimmer/OpenAI) for high naturalness. Bot is now uniwersal (handles inbound/outbound, recruitment, and sales).
- **Legal Infrastructure:** Drafted a professional legal suite in Polish:
    - `MASTER_SERVICE_AGREEMENT_PL.md`: Framework for B2B services via Twój Startup.
    - `RODO_DPA_PL.md`: Data processing agreement (critical for AI compliance).
    - `PARENTAL_CONSENT_FORM.md`: Official consent for Adam as a minor.
    - `LEGAL_STRATEGY_CHECKLIST.md`: Roadmap for legal and tax optimization (0% PIT).
- **Web Fixes:** Corrected the `CelestialBackground.tsx` rendering issues and added a "Trust-Builder" FAQ section.
- **GitHub Actions:** Fixed the automated deployment workflow by correcting working directory and expression syntax.
- **Business Strategy:** Identified 5 target companies in Szczecin and drafted the "Grand Slam Offer" (OFFER_GRAND_SLAM_PL.md) based on Risk Reversal and Performance-based pricing.
- **Lead Magnets Strategy:** Installed `lead-magnets` skill. Identified "Missed Call ROI Calculator" as a high-value lead magnet for the "Speed-to-Lead" offer targeting Szczecin home services companies.
- **Skill Update:** Installed `lead-magnets` v1.0.0.

## Pending
- Verification of GitHub Pages deployment once DNS propagates.
- Adam's meeting with Twój Startup in Szczecin.

## Decisions
- Switched to "Shimmer" (OpenAI) as the default Polish voice for the main bot to ensure stability without external API keys, while keeping "Zac" as a fallback.
- Defined bot identity as "Assistant from Automation Odyssey" to professionalize the brand and avoid name collisions with Adam.

## Automation Odyssey - Legal & Infrastructure
- **Incubator vs Independent:** Determined that for a 15-year-old in Poland, the incubator model (Twój Startup) is the only viable path to avoid months of court proceedings and ~2k PLN/msc ZUS costs.
- **Outreach:** Prepared professional email and concise business description for Kamila Galarda (Szczecin Incubator lead).
- **Web Fix:** Corrected GitHub Actions deploy path in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Repo root is the source.
- **DNS Task:** Adam needs to update Rekordy A (185.199.108.153 to .111) and CNAME (www -> xcrrr.github.io) in nazwa.pl.

## Local Migration
- **Initiated Brain Migration:** Packaging entire workspace (excluding heavy node_modules/git) into `brain_migration.tar.gz` to move to Adam's local Ubuntu PC.
- **Status:** Upload to file.io in progress (session sharp-cloud).
