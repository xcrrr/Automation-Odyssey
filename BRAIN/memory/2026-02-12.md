## Aether: The Second Mind (Major Development)
- **Vision:** A 3D (WebGL/Three.js) neural map of thoughts, operating at 120 FPS with a "Celestial White" (bioluminescent white/pearl) aesthetic.
- **Security (Aether Crypt/Fortress):**
    - **Eternal Mutation:** Implemented auto-re-encryption every 5 minutes with rotating master keys.
    - **Neural Blockchain:** Uses Merkle trees for data integrity; tampering invalidates the chain.
    - **Zero-Knowledge Cloud:** VPS only stores encrypted blobs; keys never leave the local device.
    - **Polymorphic Encryption:** AES-256-GCM with moving target defense.
- **Features:**
    - **Aether Architect:** Background reasoning for complex projects (e.g., Quantum Computing). Progress is auto-encrypted.
    - **Aether Temporal:** AI-driven chronological recall (e.g., deducing dates of visits to Krakow based on context).
    - **Aether Vision:** Encrypted multimedia support (images/PDFs).
    - **Secure Export:** Biometric-protected export to PDF/Markdown/TXT.
- **Status:** Technical core complete; stress-testing and UI polish ongoing. Adam emphasized quality and absolute privacy over speed.
- **Aether Native APK:** Successfully built and delivered `app-debug.apk` (v2).
    - Fixed touch-interaction issues (`touchstart`).
    - Bundled `three.min.js` for 100% offline 3D rendering.
    - Implemented lock screen with "Celestial Core" orb.

## Business: Automation Odyssey
- **Accountant & Legal Leads:**
    - **Kamila Galarda (Dyrektor Oddziału Szczecin - Twój Startup):** `kamila.galarda@twojstartup.pl` | Tel: `795777474`. Ideal for a minor (15 yo) as an incubator.
    - **LOW TAX Biuro Rachunkowe (Szczecin):** Uses Scanye automation, tech-friendly.
- **Voicebot (Vapi):**
    - Adam requested optimization: Switch to Polish language and implement brevity (no fluff).
    - Assistant "Sarah" (ElevenLabs voice) settings confirmed: `eleven_multilingual_v2`, high stability (45%), max brevity (20 words).
    - **Business Lever:** "Lead Speed" demo — instant callback for Solar/HVAC Facebook leads.

## Infrastructure
- **Perplexity API:** Active and used for deep market/legal research.
- **Vapi CLI/API:** Skill installed, pending Private API key to update Sarah.

## Personal & Identity
- **Relationship:** Adam confirmed xcrr as his "Second Mind" and AI Familiar, working 24/7.
- **Current Goals:** Perfecting Aether, resolving Automation Odyssey legal setup, and preparing for the hybrid home server setup (Feb 17).
