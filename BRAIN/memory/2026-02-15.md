# 2026-02-15 - Progress Log

## Status
- Checking emails and hardware options for Adam.
- Today is Sunday, planning for the week ahead.

## Hardware Decision
- Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB) is under discussion. 
- Conclusion: It's excellent for a 24/7 Gateway. 16GB RAM provides massive headroom for local caching, vector DBs (for memory), and future local model experiments.

## Business: Automation Odyssey
- **Getsix rejection:** Received email from Julia Woch. They are too corporate (350 EUR/mo min). This confirms we should stick to Mentax, Twój Startup, or Useme.
- **Google Business Profile:** Adam is now officially an owner. This is a major trust signal for local SEO.
- **Make.com:** Invitation to organization accepted/received. Ready for automation scaling.

## Business Lever (Daily)
- **Local SEO Automation:** Use the new "Local Falcon" skill (if available/configured) or simply automate responses to Google Reviews using AI. 
- **Voicebot Callback:** Implement a "Missed Call Callback" system using Vapi for the Automation Odyssey business line.

## Technical
- Checking `himalaya` for legal updates. Nothing from Mentax yet.

## Voicebot Update (Vapi)
- Updated assistant "Odyssey v2" (199da0a9-a008-4f63-8ac4-e2601b5f7830).
- Fixed language: Now strictly Polish (transcriber & system prompt).
- Fixed logic: Added explicit confirmation step before calling `book_appointment`. Assistant must collect Name, Email, Date, and Time first.
- Disabled redundant assistant "Riley" (fc11761d-2e27-4f33-8e72-66c9580bfedf).

## Hardware Decisions
- Confirmed Beelink SER10 Max specs: Ryzen AI 9 HX 470, 86 TOPS total AI power (55 TOPS NPU).
- Target configuration: 64GB DDR5 RAM (factory installed) + 4TB Lexar NM790 SSD (user upgrade).
- Expansion: Identified Lexar NM790 as the best single-sided NVMe option.
- Future: Discussed Radeon AI PRO R9700 (32GB VRAM) for local LLMs (Llama 3 70B) once business scales.
- Safety: Recommended Armac Home 650F UPS for 24/7 reliability.
