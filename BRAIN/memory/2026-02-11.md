## Current Status
- **Goal**: Localizing "Odyssey" Vapi bot to Polish and optimizing for extreme brevity.
- **Vapi API Issue**: Attempted to use key `4e62cdba-03d8-4557-849f-2395f5c5799b` found in frontend code, but it is a **Public Key** and returned 401 Unauthorized for management operations. Requested **Private API Key** from Adam.
- **Identified ID**: Assistant ID `199da0a9-a008-4f63-8ac4-e2601b5f7830` is likely the target "Odyssey" bot.

## Business & Legal
- **Lever**: Pivoted focus to "Revenue Recovery" for clinics (handling no-shows).
- **Legal**: Pursuing Mentax (tech-friendly) or Twój Startup (incubator for minors) for invoicing.

## Next Steps
- Wait for Private Vapi API Key.
- Once obtained: Set `model.language` to `pl-PL`, select a Polish voice, and update system prompt for max brevity (max 20 words per turn).
- Verify Make.com webhook: `https://hook.eu2.make.com/2ondp8k5pm02tjy02p22oai86h0l4mnl`.
