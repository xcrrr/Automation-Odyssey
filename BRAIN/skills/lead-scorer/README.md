# Lead Scorer

Stop treating all leads equally. Score them on fit, intent, and engagement — then focus your energy where it counts.

## What It Does

- **Custom scoring models** — weighted criteria across fit, intent, and engagement (0-100 scale)
- **BANT + MEDDIC qualification** — structured frameworks to qualify or disqualify fast
- **Lead grading** — A/B/C/D/F with specific next actions for each grade
- **Batch scoring** — paste a list of leads, get a ranked priority table
- **ICP matching** — score against your ideal customer profile

## Example Usage

> "Set up a lead scoring model for my B2B SaaS — we sell to mid-market HR teams"

> "Score this lead: Series B fintech, 200 employees, visited pricing page twice, CEO replied to email"

> "Here are 15 leads from this week — rank them for me"

> "Qualify this lead using MEDDIC"

## Who It's For

Sales reps, SDRs, founders, anyone with more leads than time. Stop guessing which deals to chase — let the score decide.
