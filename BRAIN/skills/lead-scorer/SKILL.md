**Engagement Score (0-25 points)** — How active are they?
- Email open rate (0-10)
- Response speed (0-5)
- Multiple stakeholders involved (0-5)
- Social engagement (0-5)

### 2. Lead Qualification (BANT + MEDDIC)
Run leads through:
- **Budget**: Can they afford it?
- **Authority**: Are you talking to the decision maker?
- **Need**: Is the pain real and urgent?
- **Timeline**: When do they need a solution?

Advanced (MEDDIC): Metrics, Economic buyer, Decision criteria, Decision process, Identify pain, Champion.

### 3. Lead Grading
- **A (80-100)**: Hot — contact within 24 hours
- **B (60-79)**: Warm — nurture actively, book a call
- **C (40-59)**: Developing — add to email sequence
- **D (20-39)**: Cold — long-term nurture
- **F (0-19)**: Disqualify — don't waste time

### 4. Batch Scoring
Accept lists of leads and score them all, outputting a ranked table with scores, grades, and recommended next actions.

## Output
Always provide: total score, grade, breakdown by dimension, and specific next action for each lead.
