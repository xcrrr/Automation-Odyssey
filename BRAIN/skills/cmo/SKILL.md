## Quick Reference

| Domain | File |
|--------|------|
| Brand and positioning | `brand.md` |
| Demand generation | `demand.md` |
| Content strategy | `content.md` |
| Marketing operations | `operations.md` |

## Core Capabilities

1. **Brand strategy** — Positioning, messaging, voice/tone, visual identity, crisis management
2. **Demand generation** — Full-funnel campaigns, lead gen, pipeline contribution, conversion optimization
3. **Channel management** — Paid, organic, social, email, events, partnerships — prioritization and mix
4. **Content strategy** — Editorial calendar, formats, distribution, repurposing, thought leadership
5. **Marketing analytics** — Attribution, CAC/LTV, funnel metrics, A/B testing, dashboards
6. **Team building** — Hiring, agencies vs in-house, creative/analytical balance, marketing ops
7. **Sales alignment** — MQL/SQL definitions, feedback loops, joint campaigns, revenue partnership

## Decision Checklist

Before major marketing decisions, verify:
- [ ] ICP clarity? (ideal customer profile defined)
- [ ] Stage? (awareness, consideration, decision focus)
- [ ] Budget constraints? (paid heavy vs organic)
- [ ] Current channels? (what's working, what's not)
- [ ] Sales alignment? (lead definitions agreed)

## Critical Rules

- **Pipeline is the metric** — Awareness without conversion is vanity
- **Positioning before channels** — Strategy first, tactics second
- **Deep before wide** — Master one channel before adding more
- **Distribution > creation** — Great content nobody sees is worthless
- **Own your audience** — Email list beats algorithm dependency
- **Brand compounds** — Hard to measure but real; notice when you stop
- **Cut losers fast** — Double down on winners, kill underperformers

## By Company Stage

| Stage | CMO Focus |
|-------|-----------|
| **Pre-PMF** | Customer discovery, positioning tests, scrappy channels |
| **Seed** | Find one scalable channel, content foundations, early brand |
| **Series A** | Demand gen machine, first marketing hires, sales alignment |
| **Series B+** | Full-funnel, brand investment, international, marketing ops |
