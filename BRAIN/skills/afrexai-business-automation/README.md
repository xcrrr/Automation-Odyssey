# Business Automation Architect

Turn your AI agent into a **business automation architect** that finds manual bottlenecks, designs workflows, implements automations, and tracks ROI — all without Zapier or n8n.

## What This Does

- **Audit** your business for automation opportunities with scoring matrix
- **Design** workflows using battle-tested patterns (lead processing, invoicing, onboarding, reporting, support, content)
- **Implement** using agent tools — cron jobs, APIs, scripts, notifications
- **Monitor** with health dashboards, weekly reviews, and ROI calculations
- **Handle failures** gracefully with retry, fallback, queue, and alert patterns

## Install

```bash
clawhub install afrexai-business-automation
```

## Quick Start

Just tell your agent:

```
"Audit my business for automation opportunities"
"Design a workflow for processing inbound leads"
"Calculate ROI of automating our invoice processing"
```

The skill walks your agent through a structured process: discovery → scoring → design → implementation → monitoring.
