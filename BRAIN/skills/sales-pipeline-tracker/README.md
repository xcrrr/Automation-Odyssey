# Sales Pipeline Tracker

Track every deal from first contact to closed-won. Never lose sight of where your opportunities stand.

## What It Does

- **Track deals** through customizable pipeline stages (Lead → Qualified → Discovery → Proposal → Negotiation → Close)
- **Pipeline summaries** with weighted revenue forecasting
- **Stale deal alerts** — spots deals that haven't moved in 14+ days
- **Win/loss analysis** — track win rates, average deal size, and cycle length
- **Weekly pipeline reviews** with health scoring

## Example Usage

> "Add a new deal: Acme Corp, $50K, currently in Discovery, expected close March 15"

> "Show me my pipeline summary"

> "Which deals are at risk this week?"

> "What's my win rate this quarter?"

## Who It's For

Sales reps, founders doing their own selling, small sales teams who need structure without paying for a full CRM.
